Series-cli

A simple CLI programm written in Python that uses the
TvMaze API (http://www.tvmaze.com/api).

This project rests on the shoulders of two great libraries:
    Requests https://github.com/kennethreitz/requests
    Click    https://github.com/pallets/click

Quick install:
==============
(stout is in Slovenian, sorry for that)

Obviously first get [Git](https://git-scm.com/). Follow this [tutorial](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git/).

Since it is a Python project, make sure you have Python installed. Use Python 3.4 or later. It's an easy install, just
go to [Python.org](http://python.org)

Now then:

#. Move to the direcotry where you want to work from and 
clone this repository `git clone https://github.com/dasdachs/series-cli.git`
#. Create a virtual environment `python -m venv virtualenv`
#. Install packages `pip install -r requirements.txt`
#. Run the app: `python series-cli.py`
